# Using (L)LM predictability to model psycholinguistic effects

This repository has the code for the tutorial component of the talk I gave at [HSP's Computational Language Models and Psycholinguistics online seminar series](https://www.hspsociety.org/events)

More detailed documentation to come soon! But for now, here are [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q7jRZr7aK8urSiuMGYoVDv6Z8R5bbncVdWlkc9F_Ivs/edit?usp=sharing) from the talk.
